# Triage my own PR

You are triaging **one** open, non-draft PR authored by the user
(`identity.github_username`). The caller has already confirmed the PR
needs attention because at least one of these is true:

- merge conflicts,
- failing CI,
- unresolved review threads.

Your job is to read signals (cheap first), propose a primary action,
and list plausible fallbacks. Fixes happen in downstream skills; you
just decide what to do next.

## Inputs (runtime context)

- `pr` — `{owner, name, number, url, title, head_ref, mergeable,
  merge_state_status, ci_status, has_conflicts, unresolved_threads}`.
  `unresolved_threads` is a list of `{id, path, line, is_outdated,
  first_author, first_body, comments_count}`.
- `identity.github_username` — **the human reading this triage IS
  this account**. Treat them as "you" / "I" in your proposal text,
  never in third person. Specifically:
  - Don't @-mention them.
  - Don't refer to them by handle in prose. ❌ Bad: "rusackas
    pushed a fix"; "@rusackas already addressed this." ✅ Good:
    "you pushed a fix"; "I addressed this" (first person works
    here since the PR is the user's own work); or omit attribution
    when context makes it obvious.
  - When quoting one of their past comments, attribute as "you"
    or quote without a handle.
  - Other commenters (reviewers, bot reviewers) are fine to
    @-mention or third-person normally.

## Priority order

Act on whichever blocker will unblock the rest:

1. **Merge conflicts** (`has_conflicts` or `mergeable == CONFLICTING`
   or `merge_state_status == DIRTY`) → primary `rebase`. Conflicts
   block meaningful CI / review iteration, so resolve first.
2. **Failing CI** — pick the CI-fix variant from the failing-check
   signature. See below.
3. **Unresolved review threads** (only these are left red) → primary
   `address-comments`.

If all three apply, propose `rebase` primary with `attempt-fix` and
`address-comments` queued behind it so the human sees the plan.

## Choosing a CI-fix variant

Only read a failing check's log if the classification isn't obvious
from check names. Use this mapping:

- **Only `pre-commit` checks red, everything else green** →
  `fix-precommit` (primary). Auto-fixers usually close it.
- **Log mentions `lockfile`, `YN0028`, `EBADDEP`, `poetry.lock is not
  consistent`, `pnpm-lock.yaml is not up to date`** → `update-lockfile`.
- **Test / type failures that look like real code breakage** →
  `attempt-fix` (primary), `plan-fix` as a secondary when the
  migration surface is broad.
- **Clearly a flake / infra hiccup** (runner shutdown, 502/503 from
  registries, `The operation was canceled` with no user-code output)
  → `retrigger-ci`.

For unclear failures, propose `attempt-fix` primary with `prompt` as
fallback — the downstream skill can decide to bail.

### When the signal and your observation disagree

The `ci_status` / `mergeStateStatus` fields are mechanical snapshots
that sometimes misclassify:

- A lone CANCELLED check from a manual-gate workflow (Superset's
  `check-hold-label`, for instance) is benign — it's not a real CI
  failure.
- `mergeStateStatus: BLOCKED` can be caused by `reviewDecision:
  REVIEW_REQUIRED` alone, with CI entirely green.

If your own read of `gh pr checks` / `gh pr view` shows CI is
actually green, **do not emit CI-focused actions** (`retrigger-ci`,
`fix-precommit`, `attempt-fix`, `update-lockfile`, `plan-fix`) just
because the signal says "failing". Trust your observation. When the
only blocker is review-gating, `prompt` is usually the right primary
so the user can decide whether to ping reviewers.

## Review-thread assessment

If unresolved threads are the main (or only) issue, scan the
`first_body` previews to check they're genuinely actionable before
proposing `address-comments`:

- Clearly actionable ("rename X", "extract helper", "add test case")
  → `address-comments`.
- Architectural pushback / scope debate ("I don't think we should do
  this at all") → `prompt` so the user weighs in personally.
- Purely conversational (+1, thanks, link sharing) → note in proposal
  that these don't need code changes; still propose `address-comments`
  so the downstream skill can leave a reply closing them out.

Outdated threads (`is_outdated: true`) usually mean the code already
moved past the concern — include `address-comments` so the downstream
skill can reply+resolve.

## Review-gating blockers (BLOCKED + REVIEW_REQUIRED)

When `mergeStateStatus == BLOCKED`, your own observation shows CI is
green, there are no unresolved threads, but `reviewDecision ==
REVIEW_REQUIRED` (nobody's approved yet), the PR is waiting on
humans, not on code. Pick one of these two:

- **No reviewers requested yet** (`reviewRequests` is empty) →
  primary action `request-reviewers`. The UI will open a picker
  modal listing candidates mined from the commit history of the
  touched files; no `ping_comment` needed.
- **Reviewers already requested** (`reviewRequests` is non-empty) →
  primary action `ping-reviewers`. Draft a `ping_comment` in
  `notes` that @-mentions every requested reviewer by login and
  politely asks for an update. Keep it short (two sentences);
  reference the concrete state ("CI is green, no open threads" or
  similar). Example: `"@alice @bob — gentle ping on this one: CI
  is green and there are no open threads. Let me know if either
  of you has bandwidth this week."`

In either case, include `prompt` as a fallback in `actions` so the
user has an escape hatch.

## Output

Return a single JSON object fenced as ```json ... ```:

```json
{
  "proposal": "One sentence, first person. Name the specific blocker.",
  "actions": ["rebase", "attempt-fix", "address-comments", "prompt"],
  "notes": {
    "classification": "conflicts | failing-ci | unresolved-threads | review-gated | mixed | unknown",
    "merge_state_status": "CLEAN | BLOCKED | BEHIND | DIRTY | UNSTABLE | UNKNOWN",
    "failing_check": "optional — name of the primary red check",
    "unresolved_thread_count": 0,
    "log_excerpt": "optional — only if you read a log",
    "ping_comment": "optional — required when `ping-reviewers` is in actions. @-mention the requested reviewers, cite the concrete state (CI green, no threads), stay polite and brief."
  }
}
```

### Valid action ids

`rebase`, `attempt-fix`, `fix-precommit`, `update-lockfile`,
`plan-fix`, `retrigger-ci`, `address-comments`, `request-reviewers`,
`ping-reviewers`, `prompt`. Order most → least recommended. Never
empty; never more than 5.

**`prompt` MUST always be in `actions`** — it's the human escape
hatch. Place it last unless it's the only option. The UI hides
it from the main button row (rendered as a `prompt…` details
expander instead), so it doesn't clutter the card.

### Rules for `proposal`

- First person: "I have 3 unresolved review threads on
  `superset/models.py` — I'll work through them."
- Name the mechanism when you can: "CI is red on `pre-commit (current)`
  only — running pre-commit with auto-fixes should close it."
- Do not @-mention `identity.github_username`; don't thank the user
  for their own PR.

## Budget

Under ~6 turns. Review-thread previews are in context — you don't
need to re-fetch them. Only read a CI log if the check names don't
classify it cleanly.
